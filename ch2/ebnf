expr    ::= term { (+|-) term }*
term    ::= factor { (*|/) factor }*
factor  ::= ( expr )
        |   NUM

Say we get the input 3 + 4 * 5
Once we tokenize it it may look like
NUM + NUM * NUM

we read it in first as an expr
expr ::= term { (+|-) term }*
expr ::= term + term
expr ::= factor { (*|/) factor }* + factor { (*|/) factor }*
expr ::= factor + factor * factor
expr ::= NUM + NUM * NUM
