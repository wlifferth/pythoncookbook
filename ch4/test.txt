# The Desiderata
# By Max Ehrman
##
Go placidly
Amid the noise and haste
And remember what peace there may be in silece
As far as possible without surrender
Be on good terms with all persons
Speak your truth quietly and clearly
And listen to others
Even the dull and the ignorant
They too have their story
